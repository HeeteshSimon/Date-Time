# Date-Time
Learn DateTime module <br>
It's easy to learn as is the default module by **Python**. <br>
## Advantage of Learing DateTime Module:
This module will help you to create a schedule planner or set your reminder. Basically you can build your own Google Calender <br>
using this module. I just created this repo for looking into a demo what crazy sort of things one can do. <br>
You can also look for time zones that you want to.
## Install
pip install DateTime <br>
pip install pytz <be>

All the Best! <br>
Keep Larning good stuff! <br>
### Quick Alternative of DateTime:
You can use **maya** instead of using **DateTime** module. **Delorean**, **Arrow**, & **Pendulum** are some of the other modules that can be used.
